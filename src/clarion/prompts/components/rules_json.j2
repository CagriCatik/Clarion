IMPORTANT:
1. Return ONLY the JSON object.
2. Do NOT return the schema definition itself.
3. Do NOT wrap the entire output in markdown blocks (like ```json ... ```).
4. Do NOT include any explanatory text.
5. Populate the fields based on the user's request.
6. The JSON field values MUST contain valid markdown (including ```mermaid blocks) where appropriate.
